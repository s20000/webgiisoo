Release history
===============

2011.05:
  - Show problematic JPEG files. Thank to Bob Friesenhahn for the hint.
2011:
  - Minor improvement by library update 8c.
2010.01:
  - New IJG JPEG 8 pre-release version code base.
    New option "Save With Zoom" for "lossless" rescaling
    of JPEG images.
2009.04:
  - New IJG JPEG 7 pre-release version code base.
    The load interface is already capable for the coming
    v8 smartscale extension.
    v8 development will start immediately after v7 release.
2008.08:
  - Minor corrections and cosmetic changes.
    Thanks for new program icons and images to Niko Lackovic.
2004.06:
  - Minor improvements and optimizations.
2003.04:
  - Right mouse button sets zoom level directly in zoom slider control.
2003.01:
  - New zoom control providing 16 zoom levels from 12.5% (1/8) to 200%
    (2/1) in 12.5% (1/8) increments. Corresponds to new "djpeg -scale
    N/8" feature for ALL N=1...16 in "Zoom Reload" mode.
  - "Zoom Reload" and "16-Bit Dither (FixPix)" are now ON by default.
    May change via Preferences.
2002.03.12:
  - Added 2:3 enlarged zoom view.
2002.03:
  - Added 1:2 enlarged zoom view. Uses a new unique JPEG specific
    upsampling algorithm in "Zoom Reload" mode which is both fast
    and of highest quality.
2002.02.23:
  - Jpegcrop now uses faster algorithms for downscale in "Zoom Reload"
    mode. See http://jpegclub.org/jidctred/ for more information.
2002.02:
  - Added Progressive Coding and Grayscale Reduction options.
2002.01:
  - Added "Zoom Reload" option in "Preferences": Causes the image to
    reload for resampled zoom view using "djpeg -scale" option.
2001.05.13:
  - "Define Frame Parameters" (right mouse button popup menu) extended
    with direct crop specification. Allows exchange of crop parameters
    via copy and paste with other applications such as cPicture.
2001.05.07:
  - Added Zoom View option to support handling of large images.
2001.05:
  - Added "Edit - Select All" menu command to reset selection.
2001.02:
  - Preserve File Time option added. Default is on.
2001.01:
  - Improved Exif operation. Avoid problem with the Fuji Exif Viewer.
    Thanks to Sebastian Djupsjöbacka for the feedback.
    See http://jpegclub.org/exifpatch.html for more information.
2K.07:
  - It is now possible to overwrite the original file. Use with care!
    Thanks to Michael Timler for the hint.
2K.06.10:
  - 16-Bit Dither (FixPix) option added in "Preferences".
    See http://sylvana.net/fixpix/ for explanation.
    Thanks to Pierre Geneves for the suggestion.
2K.06:
  - "Crop Mask" mode added.
    Thanks to Harald Margraf for the suggestion.
2K.05:
  - Lossless transformation (rotation, flipping, etc.) operations added.
2K.04:
  - Option "Endpoint Snap" added:
    While dragging the frame snap the endpoint on the block grid.
    This is recommended and is therefore the default setting now.
    It results in complete MCUs in the output image, which is
    advantageous under certain conditions.
    Thanks to Jim for the suggestion.
2K.01:
  - Save and Load of Preferences added.
99.11:
  - Added "Preferences" Feature: Allows selection of "Entropy Coding
    Method" (Huffmann default/Huffman optimized) and "Marker Copy
    Option" (None/Comments/All).
    Thanks to Jann Traschewski for the suggestion.
99.07:
  - Initial version.


Jpegcrop - lossless cropping and rotation of JPEG files
=======================================================

You simply select a frame in the displayed image and save it as new file
without recompression (see also right mouse popup menu).
The left and upper border of the cropped frame are automatically
restricted to the MCU boundaries (16*8 in most digicam pics, 16*16 or 8*8
otherwise) by the program in all selection processes, so you see directly
the effective crop area.  This automatic adaption is actually the main
feature regarding the lossless cropping.  The visible block margin grid
(toggle by menu/button) in the displayed image is also an important
feature in this regard.

In the status bar the actual selection coordinates are tracked, in the
same format as used with the commandline "jpegtran" utility
("-crop WxH+X+Y" : width, height, x-offset, y-offset).
The "Jpegcrop" program uses the original (beta) transformation support
code of the IJG software, with direct function calls.
(Note that the "Save Frame As" action will cause the file to be re-read
and processed in "jpegtran" manner which avoids the recompression.)

The source code of the program (VC++ 6.0 with MFC) is freely available
for download from the JPEGclub.org site.

Happy Jpeging,
Guido
